# Substitution
This tool is created by MieskeB (v1.0)

How to use this tool:
- Start the Java application
- Give a substitution encoded string
- Give extra hints to the machine so solving will be faster
- Give how many results you want to get
- Say yes or no, wheter you want a word checker enabled or not

Now it will start bruteforcing the cipher and give you the amount of findings. This might take a long time but you can even find substitution answers as small as 4 characters long with it!
